#
# IMPORTANT FOR NETLIFY FREE TIER USERS:
# This file is for LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY.
#
# Netlify's free tier doesn't support environment variables in the UI.
# The production Firebase credentials are set as fallback defaults in
# src/Firebase/config.js, so your app will work immediately after deployment
# without any configuration.
#
# You only need to create .env.development for local testing.
# ============================================================================

# Environment (development, staging, production)
REACT_APP_ENV=development

# Firebase Configuration
# For local development, copy these from your Firebase project console
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-project-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.firebasestorage.app
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id

# Optional: Analytics Measurement ID
# REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id

# Google reCAPTCHA v3
# Get this from: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin
REACT_APP_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your-recaptcha-site-key-here

# Google Analytics 4
# Get this from: https://analytics.google.com/ (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
# Note: GA4 is configured in public/index.html, not via environment variables
# REACT_APP_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# ============================================================================
# Notes:
# - These variables are only used during local development (npm start)
# - Production deploys use the fallback values in src/Firebase/config.js
# - Google Analytics is configured directly in public/index.html
# - This file should NEVER be committed (it's in .gitignore)
# - reCAPTCHA Secret Key should NEVER be in frontend (server-side only!)
