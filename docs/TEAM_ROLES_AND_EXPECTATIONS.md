### Option A: Equity Split (Recommended for Long-Term Commitment)

Based on [2025 industry standards](https://promise.legal/startup-legal-guide/formation/equity-splits), here are recommended equity allocations:

#### Scenario 1: Equal Risk, Near-Equal Split
*Best when all parties commit significant time from day one*

| Role | Equity % | Vesting | Cliff | Rationale |
|------|----------|---------|-------|-----------|
| Founder (You) | 50% | None (founder shares) | - | Original idea, existing codebase, product vision |
| Full Stack Dev/DevOps | 30% | 4 years | 1 year | Technical execution, infrastructure investment |
| Digital Strategist | 20% | 4 years | 1 year | Growth & market strategy |

**What This Means Financially (Year 3 at $238K profit):**
- Founder: $119,275/year
- Developer: $71,565/year
- Strategist: $47,710/year

#### Scenario 2: Founder Premium Split
*Reflects founder's prior work and ongoing product leadership*

| Role | Equity % | Vesting | Cliff | Rationale |
|------|----------|---------|-------|-----------|
| Founder (You) | 60% | None | - | Prior work, IP ownership, full-time commitment |
| Full Stack Dev/DevOps | 25% | 4 years | 1 year | [CTO-level equity for early stage](https://digitaldefynd.com/IQ/cto-equity/) |
| Digital Strategist | 15% | 4 years | 1 year | Part-time/advisory capacity |

**What This Means Financially (Year 3 at $238K profit):**
- Founder: $143,130/year
- Developer: $59,637/year
- Strategist: $35,782/year

#### Scenario 3: Technical Co-Founder Model
*If developer takes on true co-founder role with equal time commitment*

| Role | Equity % | Vesting | Cliff |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| Founder (You) | 45% | None | - |
| Full Stack Dev (Co-Founder) | 40% | 4 years | 1 year |
| Digital Strategist | 15% | 4 years | 1 year |

*[Technical co-founders typically receive 20-50%](https://uxcontinuum.com/blog/startup-cto/technical-cofounder-equity) when joining at the earliest stages with no salary.*

---

### Option B: Sweat Equity + Revenue Share

*Best for uncertain commitment levels or when team members can't go without income.*

Based on [sweat equity best practices](https://www.cakeequity.com/guides/sweat-equity):

#### How It Works:
1. Track hours contributed by each team member
2. Assign hourly rate value (market rate for their skills)
3. Accumulate "sweat equity credits"
4. Convert to revenue share OR equity at milestone

#### Proposed Structure:

**Hourly Rate Values (Market Reference):**
| Role | Market Rate/Hour | Discounted Rate (Startup) |
|------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Full Stack Developer | $75-150/hr | $50/hr credited |
| DevOps Engineer | $80-120/hr | $45/hr credited |
| Digital Strategist | $50-100/hr | $35/hr credited |

**Revenue Share Tiers (Until Equity Conversion):**

| Monthly Revenue | Founder | Developer | Strategist |
|-----------------|---------|-----------|------------|
| $0 - $1,000 | 100% | 0% | 0% |
| $1,001 - $5,000 | 60% | 25% | 15% |
| $5,001 - $10,000 | 55% | 28% | 17% |
| $10,001+ | 50% | 30% | 20% |

**Example: Year 2, Q4 ($7,000/month revenue)**
- Founder: $3,850/month
- Developer: $1,960/month
- Strategist: $1,190/month

**Equity Conversion Trigger:**
When cumulative revenue reaches $50,000 OR 18 months (whichever first), sweat equity converts to actual equity based on:
- Total credited hours × rate ÷ company valuation at conversion

---

### Option C: Deferred Compensation + Milestone Equity

*Best for team members who need predictable future payouts.*

#### Structure:

**Phase 1: Pre-Revenue (Months 1-12)**
- No cash compensation
- Track all hours at agreed rates
- Accumulate as "deferred compensation debt"

**Phase 2: Revenue Generation (Month 13+)**
- 50% of profits go to debt repayment
- Remaining 50% split by equity percentage
- Debt paid in order of seniority

**Milestone Equity Grants:**

| Milestone | Developer Grant | Strategist Grant |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| MVP Launch | 5% | 3% |
| First 100 Paying Users | 5% | 3% |
| $10K MRR | 5% | 4% |
| $50K MRR | 5% | 5% |
| **Total Possible** | **20%** | **15%** |

*All grants vest immediately upon milestone achievement.*

**Example Calculation:**

Developer works 20 hrs/week × 52 weeks × $50/hr = **$52,000 deferred**
Strategist works 10 hrs/week × 52 weeks × $35/hr = **$18,200 deferred**

At $50K cumulative revenue:
- 50% ($25K) pays down debt
- Developer receives: $18,571 (pro-rata share)
- Strategist receives: $6,429 (pro-rata share)
- Remaining debt carries forward

---

### Comparison Summary

| Factor | Option A: Equity | Option B: Rev Share | Option C: Deferred |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Risk Level | High | Medium | Low |
| Upside Potential | Highest | Medium | Defined |
| Cash Flow Now | None | After revenue | None until milestone |
| Complexity | Low | Medium | High |
| Exit Value | Full equity stake | Limited | Capped |
| Best For | True believers | Hedgers | Need certainty |

---

### Recommended Approach

Based on your situation (early-stage, no revenue, building team):

**Primary: Option A, Scenario 2 (60/25/15)**
- Clear ownership from day one
- Standard 4-year vesting protects everyone
- Developer's infrastructure contribution counts as "investment"

**Alternative: Hybrid Approach**
- Start with Option B (revenue share) for 6 months
- Convert to Option A equity split once everyone proves commitment
- This is a "try before you buy" model

---

### Infrastructure Value Calculation

The developer is contributing hosting and domain. Here's how to value this:

| Contribution | Monthly Value | Annual Value | 3-Year Value |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Domain Name | $4 | $50 | $150 |
| Hosting (Quality) | $20-100 | $240-1,200 | $720-3,600 |
| SSL/Security | $0-20 | $0-240 | $0-720 |
| DevOps Time | Variable | Variable | Variable |
| **Total** | **$24-124** | **$290-1,490** | **$870-4,470** |

**Recommendation:** Value infrastructure contribution at $1,000-2,000/year and either:
1. Credit toward equity vesting acceleration, OR
2. Deduct from any future compensation owed, OR
3. Consider as part of their equity justification

---

### Key Considerations

Based on [Y Combinator guidance](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/5x-how-to-split-equity-among-co-founders) and [industry best practices](https://www.failory.com/blog/how-to-split-equity):

1. **Vesting schedules protect all parties** - Without vesting, someone could leave after 3 months with 25% of the company
2. **1-year cliff is standard** - No equity earned until 12 months of commitment
3. **Document everything** - Verbal agreements lead to disputes
4. **Revisit annually** - Contributions change, agreements can too
5. **Plan for exits** - What happens if someone leaves?
6. **IP assignment** - All work product belongs to the company
